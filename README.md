# A-star-Demo
This project is a demonstration of the A* pathfinding algorithm using Python and Pygame. It visualizes how the algorithm searches for the shortest path between two points on a grid, avoiding obstacles.

**Features**
Right-click to place the start, end, or barrier nodes.
Press Space to run the A* pathfinding algorithm.
Press C to reset the grid and start over.

**Requirements**
Make sure you have Python installed along with the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip.


**How to Use
Right-click to place:**
First click: Start node (green)
Second click: End node (red)
Additional clicks: Barrier nodes (black)
Press Space: Start the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and end nodes.

Press C: Clear the grid and reset the nodes.

**A* Algorithm Overview**
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used in many applications such as games, navigation, and artificial intelligence. It finds the shortest path between two nodes on a graph by considering both the cost of the path and the estimated cost to the goal (heuristic).
